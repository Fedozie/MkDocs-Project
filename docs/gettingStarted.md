# **Getting Started with MkDocs**
An introductory tutorial to MkDocs.

## Introduction
In today's digital world, having an organized and easily accessible documentation website is crucial for many organizations. This is where static site generators come into play. 

Static site generators are tools that transform plain text files, typically written in Markdown or a similar markup language, into a fully functional website consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Unlike dynamic websites that generate content on the fly using server-side processing, static site generators pre-generate all the pages of a website ahead of time simplifying the process of creating and maintaining websites, particularly documentation-focused ones, by eliminating the need for complex server-side technologies.

MkDocs is one such static site generator that specifically focuses on creating documentation websites. It simplifies the process of converting Markdown files into a polished and user-friendly website. MkDocs provides a streamlined workflow for beginners, enabling them to concentrate on crafting high-quality documentation rather than dealing with complex technical details.

## What is MKDocs?
MkDocs is one such static site generator. 

It is an intuitive and powerful tool designed to simplify the process of creating and maintaining documentation websites using Markdown syntax. As a beginner-friendly static site generator, MkDocs allows you to effortlessly convert your documentation written in Markdown into a professional-looking HTML-based site.

These features make MkDocs a powerful and user-friendly choice for generating professional documentation websites with ease.

## Installing MkDocs

### Requirements for installing MkDocs
MkDocs requires a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the Python package manager, [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), to be installed on your system.

You can check if you already have these installed from the command line or terminal:

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.11.4
$ pip --version
pip 23.1.2 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pip (python 3.11)
```
If you already have those packages installed, you may skip down to [Installation of MkDocs](#installation-of-mkdocs).

### Installing Python
To use MkDocs on your system, you have to have first installed Python followed by Pip.

1. Go to the [Downloads Tab](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on the official Python website.
2. After the installer is downloaded, double-click the downloaded file to run the Python installer. Follow the prompt commands to properly install it on your computer. 
3. When it is done installing, run the `python --version` command in your terminal or command prompt to be sure that it is properly installed.

### Installing Pip
After installing Python, the next thing we would need to install is Pip. There are two mechanisms to install pip supported directly by pipâ€™s maintainers:

1. [`ensurepip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#ensurepip)
2. [`get-pip.py`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py)

But, we would be using the `get-pip.py` mechanism here.

To install Pip with `get-pip.py`, these are the steps to follow:

1. Open your Terminal and put in the following command `$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py` and hit Enter.
2. After, it is done. Type in `python3 get-pip.py` and hit Enter to install Python Pip.
3. To check that Pip was properly installed, type in the command `$ pip --version`


### Installation of MkDocs
Install the `mkdocs` package using pip:
```
$ pip install mkdocs
```

Now that you have installed MkDocs on your system, run `mkdocs --version` to check that everything works fine.
```
$ mkdocs --version
mkdocs, version 1.4.3 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mkdocs (Python 3.11)
```
